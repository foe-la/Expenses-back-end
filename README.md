# Expenses Tracker App backend

I created this backend repository with sample data and routes for use with my external front-end application. My goal is to combine the two for a fullstack application.

## User Stories

I can create a transaction (Create Expense).
I can view a history of transactions (Read Expenses).
I can edit an expense (Update Expense).
I can view an expense (Read Expense).
I can delete an expense (Delete Expenses).

## Technologies Used for Expenses Tracker App API:

Node.js
Express.js
Mongoose and MongoDB

## How to Install Expenses App API locally:

Fork and clone this repository to your machine
Change into the new directory
In your IDEs terminal, run the application by using:
$ npm install

Open another terminal tab, and run nodemon:
$ nodemon server

Once up and running, navigate to http://localhost:3030/expenses

You're all set to run Expenses Tracker App API on your machine. You will can add transactions and see the history of the transactions added.

## Challenges During this Project

Being relatively new to coding, I had challanges with getting my backend to connect to my frontend.

All in all I enjoyed the problem solving of working with my application and I want to explore creating more complex models.

I built my frontend application with React, which you can view here. https://github.com/foe-la/Expenses-front-end.git

## Future Plans for Expense Tracker App:

A goal is to use this API for other separate front end applications, as it is now, but with full CRUD capabilities regardless of the front end application.

I also thought about adding charts to show the trends in the users spending and to be able to add user authentication so it would give a layer of privacy pertaining to expenses.
